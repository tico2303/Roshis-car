    # teleop_twist_joy: Xbox controller -> /cmd_vel (geometry_msgs/Twist)
    #
    #   - "linear"  = straight-line motion (forward/back, left/right, up/down)
    #   - "angular" = rotation around an axis (turning/spinning)
    #
    # For a Daro car:
    #   - linear.x   => drive forward/backward
    #   - angular.yaw (published as angular.z in /cmd_vel) => turn left/right
    #

    # Xbox controllers using xpadneo
    #   axes[0] = Left Stick X   (left/right)
    #   axes[1] = Left Stick Y   (up/down)      
    #   axes[2] = LT trigger     (often 1.0 at rest -> -1.0 pressed)
    #   axes[3] = Right Stick X  (left/right)   <-- usually best for turning
    #   axes[4] = Right Stick Y  (up/down)
    #   axes[5] = RT trigger     (often 1.0 at rest -> -1.0 pressed)
    #   axes[6] = D-pad X or other (varies: sometimes D-pad, sometimes "unused")
    #   axes[7] = D-pad Y or other (varies)
    #
    # Verify mapping with:
    #   ros2 topic echo /joy

    axis_linear:
      x: 1        # axes[1] = Left Stick Y (common;
      y: -1     # not used  
      z: -1      #not used 

    # 2) Turning mapping (angular.yaw)
    #
    # "yaw" is rotation around the vertical axis (turning left/right on the floor).
    # teleop_twist_joy uses "yaw" and outputs it as angular.z in the Twist message.

    axis_angular:
      yaw: 0      # axes[3] = Right Stick X (common; if turning doesn't work, try 0)
      pitch: -1   # unused
      roll: -1    # unused

    # 3) Scaling (how sensitive it is)
    #
    # scale_linear.x sets how fast you go for full stick deflection.
    # scale_angular.yaw sets how fast you turn for full stick deflection.
    #
    # just multipliers:
    #   output = input * scale

    scale_linear:
      x: 1.0
      y: 0.0
      z: 0.0

    scale_angular:
      yaw: 1.0
      pitch: 0.0
      roll: 0.0

    # 4) Safety gating (deadman switch)
    #
    # require_enable_button:
    #   - true  => you MUST hold a button to allow motion (recommended for robots)
    #   - false => motion happens whenever stick moves (good for initial debugging)
    #
    # not using now could be useful later

    require_enable_button: false
    enable_button: 5          # ignored when require_enable_button is false

    # 5) Optional "turbo" mode
    #
    # enable_turbo_button: hold this button to use turbo scales instead

    enable_turbo_button: -1   # -1 disables turbo button

    scale_linear_turbo:
      x: 1.0
      y: 0.0
      z: 0.0

    scale_angular_turbo:
      yaw: 3.0
      pitch: 0.0
      roll: 0.0
